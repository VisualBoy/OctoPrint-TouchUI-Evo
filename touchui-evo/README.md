# 🖲️ TouchUI Evo

**TouchUI Evo** is a modern, responsive, and highly customizable web interface for controlling 3D printers.
Built with **React** and **TypeScript**, it features a dark theme with lime green accents and is designed as a next-generation replacement for the now-abandoned [TouchUI by BillyBlaze](https://github.com/BillyBlaze/OctoPrint-TouchUI).

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔄 **Real-time Updates**
  Uses **WebSockets** to stream live data from the printer, such as temperatures, print progress, and status.

  The interface is built from a set of customizable widgets:

  * Temperature monitoring
  * Print progress
  * Printer status
  * Quick controls (e.g., axis movement, start/stop print)
  * 📦 *Drag-and-drop layout* using `react-grid-layout` and `react-dnd`.

* 📱 **Responsive Design**
  Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

* 🔌 **Plugin Architecture** *(planned)*
  Support for dynamically loading custom React components to extend functionality.

* 📈 **G-code Viewer Integration** *(planned)*
  Integration with [`react-gcode-viewer`](https://github.com/canvasketchup/react-gcode-viewer) for live G-code visualization.

* 💻 **Terminal Access** *(planned)*
  Embedded terminal support via [`xterm-react`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js).
